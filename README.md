# My Personal Project

## Research (Experiment) Data

The aim of the  project is to be able to capture all the data a **research assistant** runs. This includes:
 - experiments the research assistant might be part of
 - Capturing all the data of different participants that are participating in any of the experiments
 
 
 As I am  interested in *research* and understand how much time and effort goes into the saving data, I wish to 
 develop something that would help other researchers too. 
 
## User Stories
1) As a user, I want to be able to view all participants' names in a specific experiment 
2) As a user, I want to be able  to add a participant to a specific experiment 
3) As a user, I want to be able to view a participants relevant data 
4) As a user, I wish to be able to remove a participant from an experiment
5) As a user, I wish to be able to add a data entry to a particular participants' data
6) As a user, I want to be able to save all participants in an experiment to file
7) As a user, I want to be able to optionally load my participants from file when the program starts


Overall note: You can't press Input dataEntry without filling in the input data and input id textbox. Also, you can't
